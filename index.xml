&lt;p>The HAT Run is held on the trails of Susquehanna State Park. The course is mostly single track trail with a mix of open fields, dirt road and some paved road. The course features nearly 4,300 feet of climbing. There is a starting loop of 3 miles followed by two identical loops of 14 miles. There are 4 stream crossings that can be challenging depending on the water level – there is always the chance of getting wet feet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteers</title><link>https://hatrun.com/volunteers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hatrun.com/volunteers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="calling-all-volunteers">Calling all VOLUNTEERS…&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Absolutely NO Transferring of bib numbers. Registered runners only! This is critical to the safe tracking of all participants and the future of this event. If you are caught transferring or selling your bib, using a pacer or running as a bandit, you will be barred from future events.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Time Constraints will be STRICTLY enforced. These are not suggestions and are no longer up to the discretion of event staff or participants. A runner MUST LEAVE an aid station ahead of cut off times. If you do not make a cut off time, please hand bib number to course marshall. The aid station captain will see that you have a ride back to race HQ. Anyone who finishes the race after 9:00 hours or 5:30 PM will be listed on the official finish with No Time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
