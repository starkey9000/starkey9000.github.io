The course is mostly single track trail with a mix of open fields, dirt road and some paved road. The course features nearly 4,300 feet of climbing. There is a starting loop of 3 miles followed by two identical loops of 14 miles. There are 4 stream crossings that can be challenging depending on the water level – there is always the chance of getting wet feet.</description></item><item><title>Volunteers</title><link>https://hatrun.com/volunteers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hatrun.com/volunteers/</guid><description>Calling all VOLUNTEERS… The volunteers make this race what it is!
