## Calling all VOLUNTEERS…
The volunteers make this race what it is!  Please come and join us again, if you don’t have the time of your life, we’ll refund you in full.

We’re using UltraSignup again this year and the locations and shift times will
be listed. We will need volunteers for Friday setup &amp; packet pickup as well as
Saturday race day registration, course marshals, aid station support, and trail
sweeps.

You must register to volunteer on UltraSignup.  The link will be available mid
to late February.

Thank you again.

Ginn, Tim, and Seth
