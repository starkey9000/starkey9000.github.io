There are 2 great viewing spots on the HAT run course to catch your runner multiple times.

Start / Finish and Upper Aid Station
Steppingstone Museum
461 Quaker Bottom Road

Lower Aid
Deer Creek Picnic Area
948 Stafford Road

The route between the 2 aid stations will be marked on race day with purple ‘pie-plates’.

Please drive carefully as you will cross the course multiple times along the way.  Please do not stop on the road, except for the safety of runners.

A race-day time schedule, including when runners will be at each of these spots is on the runner page.
