The course is mostly single track trail with a mix of open fields, dirt road and some paved road. The course features nearly 4,300 feet of climbing. There is a starting loop of 3 miles followed by two identical loops of 14 miles. There are 4 stream crossings that can be challenging depending on the water level – there is always the chance of getting wet feet.</p><p><img src=../img/hat_course_map.png alt="Hat Run Course Map"></p><p><a href=https://www.plotaroute.com/route/774080>HAT 50K on www.plotaroute.com</a></p><p><div zgotmplz><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steppingstone+Farm+Museum/@39.6018227,-76.1398516,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c7c65ed0c11c41:0x5232b39734cda230!8m2!3d39.6018172!4d-76.1398981" target=_blank>Map to Steppingstone Museum</a></div></p><h2 id=pricing-schedule>Pricing Schedule</h2><p>Race registration opens Black Friday, November 24, at $90.

If the HAT Run is canceled, it is possible that you will receive no refund of your entry fee. We will, however, endeavor to issue refunds or make other compensation to the extent funds are available to do so. The occurrences that can cause a race cancellation are not predictable. Cancellations will occur when there is a serious threat to the safety of runners and volunteers such as forest fires, hurricanes, and tornadoes, or in the event of a national emergency. These generally occur with little advance notice. As run organizers, we are at the mercy of these events. The HAT Run is a volunteer-supported, non-profit event. The HAT Run is expensive because we provide quality support, apparel, and awards. The costs for this are supported by entry fees – not sponsorship. We cannot absorb all of these costs and take the risk of cancellation by ourselves. Consequently, the effect of our policy is that the entrants to the HAT Run must share in the risk that it will be canceled. Please understand this when you enter.</p><p>Here is the policy we expect to follow when the run is subject to cancellation. Each situation is different so these are only guidelines.</p><h2 id=keeping-you-informed>Keeping You Informed</h2><p>We will try to keep entrants informed when there is a potential for cancellation. We will use the web site primarily and use the HAT Run Facebook page to supplement.</p><h2 id=reimbursement>Reimbursement</h2><p>In the event that a race is canceled, we cannot promise any refund. We will first pay all outstanding bills associated with the event that we cannot cancel or legally avoid. If there is money left over after paying the expenses we have incurred, we will try to make a reimbursement to runners from the remaining entry fees available to us. The closer the cancellation is to the race date, the less likely there will be any reimbursement and if a race is stopped while in progress, there will be no reimbursement. If the amount of the refund is small, we may not bother with it, or we may only give credit toward future entry fees.</p><h2 id=rescheduling>Rescheduling</h2><p>Rescheduling the event is unlikely given the complexity of coordinating with the various County, State Park Service, the Steppingstone Museum and the State of Maryland.</p><h2 id=friday-packet-pickup>Friday Packet Pickup</h2><p>Packet pickup is held from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm in the garage near the back of the parking lot. If you are new to the event this is a good time to familiarize yourself with the start and finish areas as well as asking any questions you may have about the event or shopping for technical running gear.</p><h2 id=race-day-schedule>Race Day Schedule</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Time of day</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6:45</td><td>Steppingstone gates open for parking</td></tr><tr><td>7:00 – 8:00</td><td>Race registration and packet pickup (Near Parking Lot)</td></tr><tr><td>8:15</td><td>Move to the pavilion and begin to assemble in the starting field</td></tr><tr><td>8:30</td><td>Start of the HAT Run.
